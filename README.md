   TOY PROBLEM 

 The function convert_to_24_hour() takes in three arguments: hour (ranging from 1 to 12), minute (ranging from 0 to 59), and period ("am" or "pm"). It converts the time into a 24-hour format and returns a four-digit string representing the time in that format.

For "am" times, it converts 12 am to 0 hours and leaves other hours unchanged.
For "pm" times, it adds 12 to the hour unless the hour is already 12 (as 12 pm remains 12 in 24-hour format).
The function then formats the hour and minute to ensure they each have two digits (e.g., '08' instead of '8'), and finally combines them to create the four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.
