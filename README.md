   TOY PROBLEM 

 The function convert_to_24_hour() takes in three arguments: hour (ranging from 1 to 12), minute (ranging from 0 to 59), and period ("am" or "pm"). It converts the time into a 24-hour format and returns a four-digit string representing the time in that format.

For "am" times, it converts 12 am to 0 hours and leaves other hours unchanged.
For "pm" times, it adds 12 to the hour unless the hour is already 12 (as 12 pm remains 12 in the 24-hour format).
The function then formats the hour and minute to ensure they each have two digits e.g., '08' instead of '8', and finally combines them to create the four-digit string representing the time in 24-hour format.


  The two_positive_numbers function takes three integer arguments (a, b, and c) and counts the number of positive integers among them. It returns True if exactly two of the integers are positive and False otherwise.

It counts positive integers by checking each integer using three separate if statements and increments the positive_count variable accordingly.
Finally, it returns True if the positive_count is equal to 2 (indicating exactly two positive integers) and  returns False otherwise.
